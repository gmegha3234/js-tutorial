//Constructor funs
//1. They start with capital letter
//2 . They should be executed only using "new" keywoard

// When a function is executed with new, it does the following steps:
//- A new obj is created and assigned to this.
//- The fun body executes.Usually it modifies this , add new properties to it.
//- The value of this is returned.

function User(name ){// constructor fun
// this = {} // implicitly
this.name = name; 
this.isAdmin = false;
 //return this; // implicitely
}
const user1 = new User("Megha");
const user2 = new User("Ruhi");
console.log(user1, user2);


//new point
//This constructor canâ€™t be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.

let data = new function(){
    this.name = "Aarohi",
    this.age = 31
};
